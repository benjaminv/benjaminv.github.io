Q: Would Jekyll V4.2 (current) run on big Sur with Apple Silicon?  
A: No!... but Yes.  

![jekyll Github Issue](/images/posts/jekyll-github-issue.png "jekyll Github Issue")

Here is one of the original issues raised by Apple Silicon users to [jekyll Github repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8576#issue-802907256).  

As of writing this post today in end of June 2021, for every single Apple Silicon machine out of the box, the answer remains.

Before install V3 Ruby via Brew I did have tried a few walk-arounds including uninstall and re-install sass gem package as [@slycke](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8576#issuecomment-798080994) suggested, but did not replace the ffi as the sys already got higher version. I gained no success eventually.

Instead of further messing up the OS I tend to agree with [@monfresh](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8576#issuecomment-812269668) just go with HomeBrew for a potentially better Version 3.0.x Ruby. Similar lessons were learned by Apple users trying to upgrade/break their shipped Python Ver 2.x on earlier versions of macOS.   

Just to be clear I did not entirely follow [@monfresh](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8576#issuecomment-812269668) for using his great script as I only wanted things simple and fixed on purpose.

After running HomeBrew flavoured Ruby (Ver 3.0.x) I was able to set up Jekyll Ver 4.2 running following the [official instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

- Command Line Tools  
you don't really need full Xcode if you are not to dev OS apps. But good to check if you have got the CLT.  
`xcode-select --install`  
Mine says follows,  
`xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates`  

- set SDKROOT  
no need of it for purely setting up and running Jekyll Ver 4.2 

- as mentioned in above, get HomeBrew version of Ruby: [How to](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruby#default)  
and check the env as the page says to make sure your Ruby is good to go side by side with the Ver 2.6.x shipped along with big Sur.

- no need of rbenv - keep thing simple

- install Jekyll  
follow exactly the instructions on the page and install the `gems` into your user directory/`$PATH` - as on Big Sur things work slightly different between `global` and per `usr`.  
**Strongly agree** with what the next paragrah on the page syas, recommend **NOT** to install `gems` Globally, this includes `bundler` and `jekyll`  

When you get all `$PATH` correct, your **Jekyll** should run now.  

Comment if you still were not able to get it running, so that someone in the community may have a look.  

**p.s.** 
- error of lack of `webrick`?  
Yes this one is needed for running Jekyll on Ruby 3.0
  - run `bundle add webrick` if you have not. then `bundle exec jekyll serve` off you go  
  - Install `webrick` if you do not have it - likely when you reach here you've already got it in the system.
